My keytaps are annoying. RNNoise does a good job of removing my keytaps, but it's not perfect; sometimes it mutes my voice when making certain sounds (voiceless consonants, laughing, exhaling).

When I'm not talking and tapping a lot (ie. while playing osu!), I want RNNoise to be on.  
When I'm talking and not tapping (ie. not playing osu!), I want RNNoise to be off.

This OBS script automatically toggles Noise Suppression during osu! gameplay.
